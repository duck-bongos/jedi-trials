# Scripts
Here you can find all the modular scripts for working with pieces of the pipeline. Names were determined for the user's convenience's sake - no name begins with the same two letters (within a file extension type).

## Table of Contents
Every script has a duplicate bash script (`.sh`) and windows batch file (`.bat`). Every pipeline module has an associated cleaning script.
